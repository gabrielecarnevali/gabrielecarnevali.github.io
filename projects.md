## Preliminary Design of a 12U CubeSat for Earth Observation

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the preliminary design (Phase 0 / Phase A) of a 12U CubeSat
dedicated to Earth Observation applications such as agricultural monitoring and
environmental change detection.

The goal of the project is to reproduce a realistic system-level design workflow,
starting from mission requirements and progressing through orbit selection,
payload performance analysis, and subsystem budgeting.

---

### Mission Objectives
- Earth Observation for environmental and agricultural monitoring
- Medium-resolution imaging (5–10 m)
- Short revisit time over selected areas
- Mission lifetime of at least 2–3 years

---

### Engineering Scope
The project covers the following aspects:

- Mission requirements definition
- Orbit selection and coverage analysis (LEO Sun-Synchronous Orbit)
- Payload performance estimation
- Mass and power budget definition with margins
- Preliminary ADCS concept and pointing requirements
- Data downlink estimation and ground segment considerations

---

### Tools & Methods
- Python (numerical modelling and plotting)
- Orbital analysis tools (e.g. GMAT / analytical models)
- Spreadsheet-based system budgets
- Requirements-driven and trade-off-based design approach

---

### Project Status
🚧 **Work in progress**

The project is currently under development.
Results and technical analyses will be progressively added and refined.

---

### Next Steps
- Detailed orbit propagation and revisit time analysis
- Payload resolution vs altitude trade-off
- Preliminary ADCS disturbance torque estimation
- Communication link budget definition
